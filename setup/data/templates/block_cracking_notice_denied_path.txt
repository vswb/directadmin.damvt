|?SUBJECT=Warning: E-Mail sent from a script below `SCRIPT_PATH` which is in the list of denied paths|
Some script below the path |SCRIPT_PATH| has just sent an E-Mail, but this is in the list of denied paths.
There could be a spammer, or the script could be compromised, as this path should not be sending any E-Mails.

|*if PATH_UNDER_USER_HOME="1"|To unblock this path, go to:
User Level -> E-Mail Accounts -> E-Mail Usage

or manually remove the path from the file:
|BLOCKED_SCRIPT_PATHS||*else|The path is outside of the User's home directory.
The only way to unblock the path is to remove it from the file:
|BLOCKED_SCRIPT_PATHS||*endif|

|*if PHP_GUESS="highest"||DEAMONNAME| has determined that the following PHP script has sent |HIGHEST_PHP_SCRIPT| E-Mails:
|BIGGEST_PHP_SCRIPT|
but the path doesn't match, so we're not sure if this is the offending script.

|*endif||*if PHP_GUESS="matched"||DEAMONNAME| has matched the following PHP script:line below the suspect path, with the number of deliveries:
|POSSIBLE_PHP_SCRIPTS|
|*endif||*if AUTO_UNBLOCK="1"|The script will also automatically be unblocked in |AUTO_UNBLOCK_HOURS| Hours.
We still highly encourage that all scripts in |SCRIPT_PATH| be examined.

|*endif|This warning was triggered by the BlockCracking monitoring tool in exim.
|*if UNKNOWN_APACHE_SCRIPT="1"|The mail was generated as the 'apache' account and |DEAMONNAME| was not able to determine the sender based on the path.
Check your exim logs and see this guide: http://help.directadmin.com/item.php?id=455|*else|The script path is managed under the |USERNAME| User account.|*endif|
