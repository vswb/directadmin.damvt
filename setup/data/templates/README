If you wish to customize these files, first copy them
into the custom directory and use them from there.

If you try to use them from this direcotry, the next time 
DirectAdmin updates, your changes will be overwritten.
Your changes will only be safe if they are in the custom
directory.

DirectAdmin will first check the custom directory for
a template. If it can't find it, it will use the ones
in this directory.

Most templates can be used in the custom dir.
Please search the Versions System at:
https://www.directadmin.com/versions.php
for info on how to use a specific template.

If you want to rewrite all httpd.conf files with the new templates, run:
echo "action=rewrite&value=httpd" >> /usr/local/directadmin/data/task.queue


**IMPORTANT NOTE**
Regarding the template system, and all config files:
You must have a newline at the end of the files.
Failure to do so will result in unexpected behavior.
Go to the end, and press enter.
In DA a line is defined by a trailing newline character.
