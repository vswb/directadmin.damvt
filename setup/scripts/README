DirectAdmin Scripts

To install DirectAdmin run ./install.sh

this will first do some checks to make sure that things are installed (named etc)

then it will ask some question and save the data to setup.txt

If you encounter errors and need to change some of the setup data, simply delete setup.txt and re-run setup.sh
